        <div class="blog-section">
            <p>Have you ever wondered why some people feel refreshed after sleeping at 10 PM, while others feel exhausted even after sleeping at 1 AM? The answer lies in our biological clock and sleep timing choices. Scientific research shows that <strong>10 PM and 11 PM are physiologically golden hours for sleep</strong>, and choosing to sleep during these hours can significantly improve sleep quality and next-day alertness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-section">
            <h2>üåô The Secret of Circadian Rhythm and Melatonin</h2>
            <p>The human body has a sophisticated biological clock system that controls our sleep-wake cycle. This system is primarily regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, which receives light signals and controls melatonin secretion.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Key Discovery</h3>
                <p><strong>Melatonin Secretion Pattern:</strong> Under normal circumstances, melatonin begins to secrete at 9-10 PM, peaks at 2-3 AM, and then gradually declines. This means that sleeping at 10-11 PM perfectly aligns with the body's natural physiological rhythm.</p>
            </div>

            <p>When we choose to sleep at 10 PM or 11 PM, we are actually working with our body's natural rhythm rather than fighting against it. It's like sailing with the current‚Äîeffortless and efficient.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Suitable for modern lifestyle rhythms</li>
                        <li>Still provides adequate time for deep sleep</li>
                        <li>Ideal for those who need more preparation time</li>

            <p><strong>Scientific Recommendation:</strong> If conditions permit, sleeping at 10 PM is the optimal choice. However, if your lifestyle runs later, sleeping at 11 PM is also an excellent option. The key is maintaining consistency and avoiding frequent changes in sleep schedule.</p>

            <h2>üß¨ The Relationship Between Sleep Timing and Health</h2>
            
            <h3>Enhanced Immune System</h3>
            <p>Research shows that people who sleep at 10-11 PM have stronger immune system function. This is because deep sleep stages are crucial periods for immune system repair and reconstruction. Choosing the right sleep time ensures you get adequate deep sleep.</p>

            <h3>Cardiovascular Health</h3>
            <p>Regular early sleep habits are associated with better cardiovascular health. People who sleep at 10-11 PM have more stable blood pressure and lower heart disease risk. This is because the body naturally lowers blood pressure at night, and early sleep allows this process to be more complete.</p>

            <h3>Enhanced Cognitive Function</h3>
            <p>Adequate sleep is crucial for brain function. People who sleep at 10-11 PM perform better in memory, attention, and creativity. This is because the brain performs important information processing and memory consolidation during the night.</p>
